This Git repository contains an extensive set of code files designed for the Robotino driver using ROS2 middleware.

Drive Motor Control: Enables the control of Robotino's drive motors utilizing omniwheel drive kinematics and implementing inverse and forward kinematic models.

Battery Management: Provides mechanisms for managing the Robotino's battery, ensuring optimal usage and monitoring.

Odometry: Estimating the current position and orientation of a robot by analyzing data from its sensors, typically wheel encoders.

Sensor Interfaces:

 - Gyroscope: Interfaces for reading data from the gyroscope sensor, providing information on orientation and rotation.
 - Camera (Realsense): Interfaces for integrating and utilizing the camera module (Realsense) with Robotino.
 - Analog Input and Output Array: Interfaces for handling analog input and output signals, facilitating interaction with external devices.
 - Digital Input and Output Array: Interfaces for managing digital input and output signals, useful for interacting with various sensors and actuators.
 - Bumper Sensors: Interfaces for reading data from bumper sensors, enabling collision detection and avoidance.
 - Laser Range Finder(hokuyo): Interface for the laser range finder sensor, used for detecting obstacles and mapping the environment.

Encouraging collaboration and contributions, the repository aims to serve as a reliable resource for researchers, developers, and enthusiasts in the fields of robotics and simulation. Regular updates ensure compatibility with evolving dependencies, making it a sustainable and valuable tool for the robotics community.

## Installation

### Installing from source:
ATTENTION: These commands assume that you have created a workspace called "robotino_driver_ws" in your home folder. If you used a different directory or name, please adjust the commands accordingly.

Install the below debian packages first(part of the repository):

    rec-rpc_1.6.1_amd64.deb
    robotino-api2_1.0.0_amd64.deb
    robotino-dev_1.0.3_amd64.deb

After installing ROS2 and creating the workspace, clone this repository in your workspace:

    cd ~/robotino_driver_ws/src
    git clone https://github.com/robocup-logistics/ros2-robotino.git
 
Install the binary dependencies by running the following command in the root of your workspace:

    cd ~/robotino_driver_ws
    rosdep init
    rosdep update

    sudo apt update

    rosdep install --from-paths src/robotino-driver --ignore-src -r -y --rosdistro humble


If all dependencies are already installed, you should see the message "All required rosdeps installed successfully."

## Building:
To build the workspace, run the following command in the root of your workspace:

    cd ~/robotino_driver_ws
    colcon build --symlink-install

If the build is successful, you should see the message "Finished [build] target(s) in [time]s."

After building the package, open a new terminal and navigate to your workspace. Then, source the overlay by running the following command:

    source /opt/ros/humble/setup.bash

Then, source the workspace by running the following command:

    cd ~/robotino_driver_ws
    source install/setup.bash

## Launch robotino driver

### Launching robotino driver - Bringup


    ros2 launch rto_node robotino_driverbringup.launch.py namespace:=robotinobase1 hostname:=172.26.108.84:12080


- namespace: It's a launch configuration used to spawn the corresponding robotinobase, its controllers, and node parameters
- hostname: It's the IP address of the robotino base and port no. for the process to run. The default IP address is 172.26.1.1:12080

### Launching robotino driver - Standalone

    ros2 launch rto_node robotino_driver.launch.py namespace:=robotinobase1

- namespace: It's a launch configuration used to spawn the corresponding robotinobase, its controllers, and node parameters
- hostname: It's the IP address of the robotino base and port no. for the process to run. The default IP address is 172.26.1.1:12080
